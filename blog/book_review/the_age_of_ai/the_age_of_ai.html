            <h3>What this book is all about</h3>
            <p>The purpose of this book is:
                <br>
                some of the main points discussed here are:
                <br>
                <br>
                Many of the problems discussed in this book are problems that have existed for a long time already. AI is not the sole cause of these type of issues, but may reinforce them. Problems like these are: 
                <br>
                <br>
                Without trying to undermine the previous problem's importance, i want to focus on the totally new ones arising from the use of AI.

      <h2>my Take-Away from this book</h2>
      <h3>What it takes to achieve the AI-Future we all want</h3>
      <p>The conclusion that this book leaves me with so far is that we should try not to let tech evolve faster than our rules for once in the history of humanity.
        Also that the general people must be involved in AI so they dont feel like being governed by something thats scary and they didnt choose. 
        Which brings me to my final conclusion, basically work needs to be done in order to remove the whole mysticism and fear factor that comes with AI. Not an easy task given that deep neural nets are basically a black box. But then we could argue that our brains are basivally a black box too. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Getting rid of mysticism and antropromorphism
        God please. Dont talk about a fancy algorithm like you would talk about a person. 
        <br>
        <br>
        We dont know exactly the mechanisms of human learning and decision making either.
