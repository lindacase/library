  <h2>Book Review:</h2>
  <h1>Siddharta by Hermann Hesse</h1>
  <h6>22/12/19</h6>
    <p>Siddharta was first published in xxxx. i've been wanting to read this book for a while now, after reading "Demian" and "Steppenwolf".'i found a copy of an 2008 edition in the usual used book store. It looks like it has never been read but used as shelf for coffee cups.
  
as i know Hesse from his other two books i've read, he does not fear anything when it comes to the most painfully honest self reflection. he sheds every shell of being in hope that under all these shells he keeps shedding he will uncover his real true self. 

what if humans are just an endless accumulation of psychological shells under which is nothing but the plain reality of atoms? or can we find some magic and some reason for living in between?
