<h1>Flowers for Algernon</h1>

<p>I'm no more to blame than the knife is to blame in a stabbing, or the car in a collision. 
    "But I'm not an inaminate object," I argued. "I'm a <i>person</i>." He looked confused for a moment and then laughed. 
    "Of course, Charlie. But I wasn't referring to now. I meant before the operation."</p>

<p>charlie said he is happy and he doesnt have a problem. he likes his friends at work with whom 
    he is always laughing and having a good time. then, slowly but surely he discovers how they have simply used him for enertainment,
    and arend his friends at all. bit by bit i witness charly discovering all the cruelties he was unaware of before.
    its painful. He is no longer having a good time at work. 

    ignorance is bliss? this saying doesnt wrap up the story at all but fits i guess.

    I dont know why but i am much reminded of "No longer Human". The part where im analyzing the very thing that was said
    that started the protagonists downfall. just a small lie that lead him to discover the fakeness of everyone.

    the more time advances (notice i say time advances and not charlie getting smarter) the more charlie is faced with 
    issues he cant make sense of. then he feels stupid again. like whats all this intelligence for if i cant figure 
    out all this stuff.

    I heard a saying that goes "the bigger the circle of the known the greater the contact with the unknown".
    it does reflect Chalies situation doesnt it?

    There is also discussions about IQ in the book. 
    i thought a lot about what IQ is and i think its a very made up thing that reflects only a small fraction of 
    what we think it does.

    would schools be better if students were divided into groups of different learning speed instead of 
    how well you fit into a system that fits only a small part of students?

    what is it really that is changing with charlie during the book, if you  cant just say "his IQ"?
    would he had been better off without the operation? is the pain he is enduring worth it?
    is it unethical for anyone to manipulate charlies brain in any way?
    is it unethical wanting chalie to change?
    charlie consented to the experiment. can we just take that consent? he is an adult. 
    is it ethical to treat him as a child that cant make his own choices?

    Is a work about exploring the human spirit. I strongly recommend it.

    Anyways, what is my take away from the book?
