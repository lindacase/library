      <h1> Visualizing Data about the<br> Production of Coffee Beans </h1>
      <h3>So this is my first Data Science project ever and there is no method but total anarchy, lots of trial and mostly error.</h3>
      <p>Dataset is from: <a>https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yamaerenay/ico-coffee-dataset-worldwide</a></p>
      <h2><br>here we go: <br>Production of Coffee Beans</h2>
      
  <section class = highlight hover >
    <h4>Attempt #1</h4>
    <p class = "container">Here is my first ever Data Chart! Its a small part of the original data Set I used. I am Starting to learn Data Science on Jupyter Notebook. </p>
    <img src="/Users/antoniabaselgia/Documents/lindas_library/blog/fun_with_data/coffe_plot1.png" height="300px;"/>
    <p>The look is ok but I am only using a fraction of a dataset that i typed from hand so i need to learn how to access a dataset directly without copying individual values into new series.</p>
  </section>
  
  <section class = highlight hover>
    <h4>Attempt #2</h4>
    <p>Ok I figured out a way to turn a part of the dataframe into a list which in turn i can plot. this method is really not handy at all but hey progress.</p>
    <img src="/Users/antoniabaselgia/Documents/lindas_library/blog/fun_with_data/coffee_plot2.png" height="300px;"/>
    <p>Next I want to try to show multiple countries in the same plot</p>
  </section>

  <section class = highlight hover>
    <h4>Attempt #3</h4>
    <p>Since Production in Brazil is magnitudes higher than in the other countries in the plot it becomes really unclear.</p>
    <img src="/Users/antoniabaselgia/Documents/lindas_library/blog/fun_with_data/coffee_plot3.png" height="300px;"/>
    <p>Maybe try a logarithmic y-scale.</p>
  </section>

  <section class = highlight hover>
    <h4>Attempt #4</h4>
    <p>Oh no this is just bad.</p>
    <img src="/Users/antoniabaselgia/Documents/lindas_library/blog/fun_with_data/coffee_plot4.png" height="300px;"/>
    <p>Let's call it a day and go study.</p>
  </section>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <h3>I figured out how to do some v simple plots in Jupiter. Thats at least something. Next I will learn about Data Analysis.
    <br>
    I should start my next Data Project with a thesis because why plot something with no point to proove.
